# Polarity
A terminal interface to the Polaris music streaming server made for a raspberry pi zero device

## Introduction
The Polarity project aims to capture track enqueueing features that were present in popular players like Winamp and combines that with music downloading through the [Polaris](https://github.com/agersant/polaris) music server. It has been developed on a raspberry pi zero 2 W with a 1.3in TFT bonnet from Adafruit.

## Components
The software is split into two executables - one that acts as the terminal and the other that plays the audio. The terminal has access to the Polaris server and downloads track info from it. The player also has Polaris access, using it to download songs and play them locally.
